## Shape and Metrics on Data

At first, we have 32,346 rows and 37 features to consider.

| Metric               | Value   |
|----------------------|---------|
| Variance of NP3TOT   | 215.60  |
| Median of NP3TOT     | 15.00   |
| Mean of NP3TOT       | 16.87   |
| Max of NP3TOT        | 100.00  |
| Min of NP3TOT        | 0.00    |

This shows considerable variance (215.60), meaning NP3TOT scores are spread out widely around the mean. The median being lower than the mean indicates right-skewed data, influenced by a few extremely high values (up to 100). Although most scores fall within 15â€“17, these outliers significantly raise the mean and variance, resulting in a wide range between the minimum and maximum values.

## Removing NaN values on NP3TOT
After removing missing values, we keep 26109 rows of the 32,346 rows.

## Check correlation between Time Progression and NP3TOT
-0.09 indicates that there is a very weak negative correlation, almost no relationship. As time moves on, the NP3TOT value slightly decreases.
